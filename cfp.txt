[[overview]]
== Overview

The recent financial crisis has renewed the financial industryâ€™s focus
on transparency and risk management.  With the accompanying broadened
regulatory scope, a new set of stakeholders have arrived at the
financial services table, each of which has a different viewpoint,
mission, skill set, and terminology.  Domain-specific languages (DSLs)
tailored to specific problems have proven to be effective in financial
systems in the past, drawing on advancements in functional languages,
ontology languages, and business process and rule modeling languages.
However, with the rapid increase in the complexity of regulatory
regimes, ad-hoc languages are becoming less effective; thus the
principled design, evolution, and maintenance of financial DSLs are
more important than ever before.

We invite participation in a workshop bringing together software
architects, engineers, and researchers in the financial services
domain who are working with domain-specific languages (DSLs) and with
frameworks for creating and managing DSLs. 

=== Topics of Interest

- Financial language development, evolution, and maintenance
- Modelling frameworks and language workbenches
- Tradeoffs between individual DSLs and the use of DSL frameworks and workbenches
- Testing, verification, and debugging
- Language semantics
- Language usability and adoption
- Industry standards and regulation

A listing of financial DSLs, as well as papers and
presentations can be found on the
http://www.dslfin.org/resources.html[resources page].

== Call for Participation

http://www.dslfin.org/dslfin-cfp.txt[Call for Papers (TXT)]

Experience reports, research papers, and position papers of __up to 10 pages__ are
sought for presentation and discussion at the workshop. Contributions
will be formally reviewed for originality, relevance, and the
potential to generate interesting discussions.

Authors of accepted papers will have _the option_ to publish their
paper in the http://ceur-ws.org/[CEUR] workshop proceedings, which is
indexed by http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/[DBLP]. All
contributions must be in English, in PDF format, using the
https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0[Springer
LNCS format].

=== Talk Abstracts

For those interested in contributing without the time commitment of
writing a full paper, we additionally seek abstracts for short talks
to be given at the workshop; abstracts should be 3-6 pages long
formatted using the
https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0[Springer
LNCS format] (which is roughly equivalent to 2-3 pages of standard
writing, due to the large margins of the LNCS format).
