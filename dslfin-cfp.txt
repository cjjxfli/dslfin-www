CALL FOR PAPERS
Workshop on Domain-Specific Languages for Financial Systems (DSLFIN)
=========================================================

Co-located with MODELS 2013 
1 October 2013, Miami, Florida - USA
http://www.dslfin.org

== Overview

The recent financial crisis has renewed the financial industry's focus
on transparency and risk management.  With the accompanying broadened
regulatory scope, a new set of stakeholders have arrived at the
financial services table, each of which has a different viewpoint,
mission, skill set, and terminology.  Domain-specific languages (DSLs)
tailored to specific problems have proven to be effective in financial
systems in the past, drawing on advancements in functional languages,
ontology languages, and business process and rule modeling languages.
However, with the rapid increase in the complexity of regulatory
regimes, ad-hoc languages are becoming less effective; thus the
principled design, evolution, and maintenance of financial DSLs are
more important than ever before.

We invite participation in a workshop bringing together software
architects, engineers, and researchers in the financial services
domain who are working with domain-specific languages (DSLs) and with
frameworks for creating and managing DSLs.

The workshop will take place as part of the ACM/IEEE 16th
International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and
Systems (MODELS 2013).

== Topics of Interest 

- Financial language development, evolution, and maintenance
- Modelling frameworks and language workbenches
- Tradeoffs between individual DSLs and the use of DSL frameworks and
  workbenches
- Testing, verification, and debugging
- Language semantics
- Language usability and adoption
- Industry standards and regulation

A listing of financial DSLs along with papers and presentations
covering these topics can be found on the workshop website:
http://www.dslfin.org/resources.html.

== Call for Participation

Experience reports and position papers of up to 10 pages are
sought for presentation and discussion at the workshop. Additionally,
we seek 3-6 page abstracts for short talks to be given at the
workshop. Contributions will be formally reviewed for originality,
relevance, and the potential to generate interesting discussions. 

Authors of accepted papers will have the option to publish their paper
in the CEUR workshop proceedings, which is indexed by DBLP. All
contributions must be in English, in PDF format, using the Springer
LNCS format.
